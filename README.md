# PU2CLR BK108X Arduino Library

The BK1088E is a single-chip solution for receiving AM, FM, and shortwave radio. 
Using inexpensive components (Arduino Pro Mini, some push buttons buttons, and a standard OLED or TFT display), the  hobbyists can build serviceable little receiver based on BK1088E with a impressive performance.  

This project is about an Arduino Library to control the BK1086 and BK1088 devices. It was based on "BK1086/88E BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER; Rev.1.3" documentation from BEKEN Corporation.

This library can be freely distributed using the MIT Free Software model.

## Preface 


At the end of 2019 I started some Arduino library development projects to control DSP receivers. The first implementation was the Arduino library for the SI4844 and then for the ICx Si473X family, all manufactured by Silicon Labs. Given the acceptance and enthusiasm of various radio listeners, experimenters and hobbyists, around the use of the implementations of these libraries, I decided to expand the number of Arduino libraries for the Arduino IDE platform and also developed the libraries for the AKC695X, KT0915, SI470X and RDA5807. When I started reading about the BK1086/88 Datasheet I notice it is also very apropriated for radio listener and hobbyists. Unlike the other devices previously mentioned, I found very few documentation about it at first. So, it encouraged me to build as much information as possible about this BEKEN family of devices. I requested some information about the BK1086/88E from BEKEN Corporation and I was promptly answered. I would like to thank the BEKEN Corporation fot its attention.

This library is based on the BEKEN manual “BK1086/88 - BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER REV1.3” provided by BEKEN Corporation and experiments made by me during the development process. 

If you are a hobbyist, a radio enthusiast and enjoy Arduino, this project is for you.

### Useful informarion

* BK1086/88 can be controlled by an MCU through 2-wire I2C mode. 
* The BK1088 already comes with 40K internal pull-up resistors on the i2c bus. Probabbly, no external pull-up resitores will be needed. However, depending on the size of the bus, consider using external pull-up resistors; 
* BK1086/88 has an internal automatic tuning technology, which can automatically adjust the internal variable capacitance value to make the resonant circuit in the best resonance state at the current operating frequency, thus greatly simplifying the front-end design;
* BK1086 only supports FM and medium wave, BK1088 supports short wave and long wave in addition to FM and medium wave;


 

## Library Installation

You can install this library on your Arduino environment using different methods. 

### Installing via Arduino IDE

This library is available on Arduino IDE platform. [This video will show you how to install the Arduino Library for the BK1086 / 88 DSP device](https://youtu.be/CvgKorUN0gE) on your local computer.

{% include libinstalling.html %} 


### Installing via the repository 

With this approach, you will have the __most current version__ of the library. However, __it may not be the most stable version__. This is because the current version is always in development. [Prefer releases](https://github.com/pu2clr/BK108X/releases). Do you need some old version (release) of this library?  If yes, [check here](https://github.com/pu2clr/BK108X/releases).

To install the current version, you have to [download](https://github.com/pu2clr/BK108X/archive/master.zip) this library in zip format.  After, unzip the BK108X-master.zip file in your Arduino Library folder.

## Schematic



### BEKEN Typical Application Schematic

The image below was extracted from "BK1086/88E BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER; Rev.1.3; page 25". It is a basic circuit suggested by BEKEN.

![BEKEN Typical Application Schematic](extras/images/basic_circuit_from_beken.png)


### BK1088E(SSOP20) and Arduino Schematic  

The schematic below is based on the BEKEN typical application schematic added to the Arduino controller. The front-end circuit has been modified to use regular antenna instead headphone antenna setup.  

The main porpuse of this circuit is to test the  BK108X Arduino Library. However, you may be surprised at the performance of this simple circuit due to the high features of the BK1086/88 device. Also, it is importante to say that this receiver does not intend to be a real radio for exigent listener. However, it is possible to start with it and then, if you wish, you can include some devices to the circuit to improve, for example,  its sensibility, output sound quality beyond other desired features.


![Basic Schematic](extras/images/basic_schematic.png)


The [example folder can guide you to check your circuit via Arduino sketches](https://github.com/pu2clr/BK108X/tree/master/examples)


## Troubleshoot

1. Place C1 (1.8pF) and the 32768KHz crystal as close as possible from the BK1088 pin 9;
2. Place C4 (100nF) as close as possible from the BK1088 pin 13;
3. Try to keep the length of the I2C bus as short as possible;
4. If you check the circuit by running the [poc01_circuit_test.ino](https://github.com/pu2clr/BK108X/tree/master/examples/bk108x_01_serial_monitor/poc01_circuit_test) and get the Chip Id value -1 (0xFF): 
   * Check whether the DC voltage on pin 10 and 13 are correct;
   * Be sure I2C connections are right;
   * Be sure whether the I2C bus speed used by your MCU master (Arduino) is correct;
   * If you are using a BK1088, the Chip Id value should be 4224 (0x1080)
5. The frequency shown on display or Arduino IDE Serial Monitor is different from the real frequency.
   * You might have problem with reference clock. If you are using the 32.768KHz crystal, check whether it is working;
   * If you are using an external clock input, check the signal with an oscilloscope (check the RCLK);
   * By default, this library used 32.768KHz as reference clock; 
   * If you need to use external reference clock or a crystal with different clock, please, read the [API documentation} (https://pu2clr.github.io/BK108X/extras/docs/html/index.html)
